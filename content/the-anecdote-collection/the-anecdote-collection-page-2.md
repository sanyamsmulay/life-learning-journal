### #87 Daaji - What is the motto of human life     
####### Tuesday 18 July 2023 02:03:25 PM IST #######

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY4pmAwR1_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY4pmAwR1_8)      
summary :
- desiring wealth to fulfil only greed and arrogance
- student duty -> study hard; result should not matter
- serving parents --> is a duty
- serving country --> is a duty
- serving family --> is a duty

- you cannot be a beggar and serve family, society and country
- noting wrong with saying that I am going to make crores of rupees and contribute to the welfare of so many things !!
money provides the freedom and means to that, it is a means to an end.
- for desire - motive and intentions - behind it matter
- they (intentions) of the desire will determine the fruits of the desire
- also the path taken to fulfil your desire matters
- involve the master in what you are doing
- work, work and work - that is the motto of our existence 

- what is duty ?
- icha puri karna ? 
-- ya zarooratein poori karna ?
- very subtly put by him:
- mother's duty is to provide you with nutritious food 
- not to fulfil your every whim and fancy

- Competence vs confidence
- after learning little - confidence soars
- after a point you realize how much you don't know
- then your confidence drops 
- and then gradually rises as your skill improves

- Mount stupid 
- how it is misconstrued
- it is quoted in support of the quote		
"Wise are full of doubts and fools are full of confidence"
- the study is not about the wise and fools (altough I agree with the quote )
