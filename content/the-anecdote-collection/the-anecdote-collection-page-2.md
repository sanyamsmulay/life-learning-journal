### #83 - Emotional Intelligence - Daniel Goleman    
####### Thursday 20 July 2023 0%:04:57 PM IST #######

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7m9eNoB3NU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7m9eNoB3NU)
- the framework / basic pillars:
	- 4 domains for emotional intelligence
	- self awareness - understanding own emotions - why you are feeling something that you are feeling
	- self regulation - regulating own emotions - handling disturbing ones and marshalling positive ones
	- empathy - understanding why someone else is feeling the way they are feeling
	- applying all three in a skilled relationship
- last part of the brain to anatomically mature
	- we should be teaching this in classes
	- and it like a part that needs to be trained with repeated exposure
- there are added benefits to training in emotional intelligence
	- eg - the pre-frontal cortext that regulates emotions, also regulates attention - one of the basic learning skills
- average IQ going up last 100 years - regular classroom programs
- can be done for EQ as well.
- men vs women
	- women - better at empathy
	- men - better at self regulation
- EQ looks different in different cultures

### #87 Daaji - What is the motto of human life     
####### Tuesday 18 July 2023 02:03:25 PM IST #######

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY4pmAwR1_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY4pmAwR1_8)      
summary :
- desiring wealth to fulfil only greed and arrogance
- student duty -> study hard; result should not matter
- serving parents --> is a duty
- serving country --> is a duty
- serving family --> is a duty

- you cannot be a beggar and serve family, society and country
- noting wrong with saying that I am going to make crores of rupees and contribute to the welfare of so many things !!
money provides the freedom and means to that, it is a means to an end.
- for desire - motive and intentions - behind it matter
- they (intentions) of the desire will determine the fruits of the desire
- also the path taken to fulfil your desire matters
- involve the master in what you are doing
- work, work and work - that is the motto of our existence 

- what is duty ?
- icha puri karna ? 
-- ya zarooratein poori karna ?
- very subtly put by him:
- mother's duty is to provide you with nutritious food 
- not to fulfil your every whim and fancy

- after learning little - confidence soars
- after a point you realize how much you don't know
- then your confidence drops 
- and then gradually rises as your skill improves

- Mount stupid 
- how it is misconstrued
- it is quoted in support of the quote		
"Wise are full of doubts and fools are full of confidence"
