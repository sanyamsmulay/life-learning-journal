### #51 - Breaking India - Rajiv Malhotra        
####### Fri Feb  2 04:15:57 PM IST 2024 #######    

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVzVjuj90E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVzVjuj90E)
- I was physically present for this talk (the guy in black in the second row !! @1:20 to @1-25)
- the talk reminds me of this image:[how to demoralise a people / nation](https://comment-cdn.9gag.com/image?ref=9gag.com#https://img-comment-fun.9cache.com/media/aoKyvp0/aa4ZZ7dJ_700w_0.jpg)
	- then they will be more pliable 
- Indian knowledge systems
	- many knowledge systems are oral
	- jati-varna and caste are not the same, caste was a force-fitting done to race theory
	- most are not Brahmanic in origin
	- eg. Zinc metallurgy was done by NOW lower-cast communities, that where THEN prosperous
	- caste system is not applicable in India consistently across times
		- class struggle is the premise of marxism - so there's an agenda
		- it should be thrown out
	- knowledge should be credited without the aforementioned politics
	- Looking at India from a western social science lens is a disservice
		- a colonial tradition has been established so nobody wants to break this 
		- lest they lose academic clout / grants / approvals from the West that they look up to
		- but there are vested interests doing this - this is my opinion
		- inferiority complex in Indians and superiority of the white skin (evident in our society) can be attributed to this kind of social science being taught
	- social science is not a science 
		- propaganda to make these people sound smart - this is my take
		- science has burden of proof, falsifiability etc
		- social science is more like a - cartel of school of thought
		- invasion theory - only invasion has caused India to progress
			- mostly to justify what Brits did - my take
		- Eg. India must align with some other block to be significant in the world, not take an independent stance
			- no faith in India being its own player on the world stage
			- this was so visionary, Jaishanker doctrine is based on this independence of stance - my take
			- this complex is not present in the Chinese
			- we are trained to keep quiet - lest we be called fascist
		- was Chair of Asian studies in Wisconsin
		- West never teaches spread of Asian civilisations - only their own 
			- why do we do the same ? - my question
			- his example - none of the whites opposed the Idea of teaching good things about Asian civilizations
			- Indians (social scientists) opposed him - my take - is this not intellectual slavery ?
			- if the west does not mention slavery and inquisition etc, why do we have to mention problems in the introduction ?
			- Chinese, Japanese supported him in presenting India+Asia in a positive light - Indians did not
		- western idea of spread of civilization is - conquest
				- spread with India - was only soft power - influence - without no army
				- mostly Indians never set out to conquer
				- but Buddhism reached Japan 
		- looking at India from science and tech lens - we get mathematicians, surgeons, etc
		- social scientists use invasion theory

### #50 - Using CRISPR to edit gut microbiome to cure asthama and reduce methane burps in cattle       
####### Mon Jan 22 11:07:54 AM IST 2024 #######    

- [https://www.wired.com/story/crispr-jennifer-doudna-microbiome/](https://www.wired.com/story/crispr-jennifer-doudna-microbiome/)
	- current state of the art
	- yet to identify the side-effects of the technique in the lab
	- this is a more targeted approach compared to diet changes - which is macro
	- also, in some cases the diet changes may not be feasible - like feeding cows sea-weed

	- RTI - protection
		- multiple committees have given an opinion on this
		- RTI and Data protection law should not be in conflict
			- recommend strengthen harm test - harm to: property, reputation, identity theft
		- 81J is used in 35% of cases - so needs to be strengthened - but allegedly it has been made blanket

### #56- Jonathan Blow           
####### Thursday 04 January 2024 05:35:44 PM IST #######    

- Open Source - how it can be better, open source is not innovating only copying
	- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLVjSeusPYg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLVjSeusPYg)
	- how to 
	- people building something worthwhile have always been opinionated
	-  need to have strong opinions on good code and bad code
	- twitter criticism - is cheap posturing - more toxic than the attitude of developers and maintainers they are criticising

- Preventing the collapse of civilisation - technology declines without conscious effort
	- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko)
	- space race - technology progress 
	- USA went to the moon and then lost the edge - had to send people in 
	- then Elon Musk, SpaceX happened
	- tech does not automatically improve - it degrades
	- civilisations have lost technology before - many examples given in the video
	- chip design example from TI - younger engineers did not take induction seriously in packaging
	- 1177BC, Eric Cline - a number of civilizations fell in 500 years - lots of tech lost
	- software is in "soft" decline
		- software has been riding hardware improvement
		- everything is buggy and people have gotten used to it
		- the quality of the software is not even a claim anymore in sales
		- is the art of producing bug-free software lost ?
		- "tech" company is also a misnomer these days
		- no new technology is being produced, just parts reassembled
		- higher level of abstraction --> my view, people do not know / care to know about the underlying details
		- loss of capability on machine and human level both - 
			- people don't know or care about the low level
			- in pursuit of abstraction compatibility/portability is lost
			- people have less deeper knowledge
			- knowledge is replaced by trivia 
				- how cahe coherency works vs how to work around unity jank
					- universal concept vs very specific info - which will get outdated by next release
				- good information 
		- sustainable complexity levels are essential for continuity
			- my view - good documentation and established training processes are a good way out
		- also, my argument for "forest for the trees, but can fix a tree if required" 
			- need people that can transcend the levels of abstraction
		- what is happening at CPU level is fragile - similar to bronze age reading knowledge
			-  the bronze age knowledge did not survive
			- why are we so sure that CPU functioning knowledge will survive
		- so need to simplify 
	- tools force a way of thinking !!! - wow ! what a question

	- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59gx55bNunU)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59gx55bNunU]
	- children tend to pick harder problem when given effort type feedback - leading to growth,
	- also, label type feedback leads children to only pick problems they know they will be good at 
	- basically humans tend to stick to the self image they build from the feedback they get
	- students did significantly better when given

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iNyqomXQt8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iNyqomXQt8)
- getting into deep work
	- we are so scared / averse to getting bored that majority will give them an electric shock rather than get bored
- All of mankind's problems arise from the fact that because people cannot sit by themselves in a room for 30 minutes alone and always needed to be stimulated and when the iPhone came along boredom was dead.
- you will do the icky work if the alternative is getting bored
- attention residue from previous active tasks, does not allow the brain to concentrate

### #72- The merits of keeping TODOs     
####### Sunday 03 September 2023 07:43:01 PM IST #######    

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XAu4EPQRmY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XAu4EPQRmY)
	- have a wavefront of progressing work to complete the goal
	- leave TODOs in your wake 
	- come back to them later
	- get to a sub-optimal solution that works first
		- start solving the problem
		- making money off it
		- and then make it better
	- `*` sometimes building gives you a better idea / more clarity about: 
		- what to build and 
		- how to build
	- so to start to build is very important
- picking your battles
	- even if that means losing a war
	- swallowing your pride and letting something be that is not ideal but can be dealt with later 
- wabi sabi
- shivaji's strategy of picking off forts from the edges
- divide an conquer - not the British version
	- but helpful with solving problems
- Paul Graham's startups should do unscalable things (to start with)
- systems engineering - 80% of the cost for a solution is decided by the early 20% design decisions
	- initial assumptions are not very good - less information
	- so some design decisions should be deferred if they can be
	- Eg. forward swept wing vs delta wings
- triage with impact on usability of solution
	- not necessarily engineering elegance

-  serving a niche is okay
- growing LTV ---> bundling, upselling, 
- loyalty -> exceptional experience throughout - buying experience,  servicing experience, product experience
  - the feeling of belonging to a community
  - feeling pride in using your product - product swag
- customers acquired from discounts - LTV is low
- identify a **recruiting product**
  - low friction 
  - instant gratification
- using surveys / calculators  / quizzes with small reward to collect user data
  - try to use this for better engagement
- try to push adjacent products
- use sub-brands / sister brands to sell other category of products
- try to get low customer acquisition channels first - that cater to niche audiences - rather than increasing spends on google,etc
- make the user your ambassador 
- be available on the marketplaces
